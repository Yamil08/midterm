							<br><p>While this may sound like a travel cliché, you’d be surprised how many tourists spend most of their time in or around the really famous places and landmarks.  And, of course, it’s important to visit these places, but New York offers so much more than a short list of easily identifiable sights (you can probably name them right now).<p></br>
							<p>There are a lot of layers to this great city, and to discover them, you have to venture out of the main tourist comfort zones.  Safety is not an issue, as serious crime in NYC remains near record lows.  In fact, NYC is now the safest big city in America!  So whatever stereotypes you have formed from past headlines or TV shows, they do not accurately reflect the city today.</p>
							<p>Is NY crowded?  Yes.  Are New Yorkers always in a rush?  Yes.  But the bad rap about us isn’t true.  Most New Yorkers are generally friendly (once you stop us to ask for help), and are usually very willing to give you directions if you get lost.  We’ll even give you our two cents free of charge!</p>
							<p>Finally, if you have more than a few days in New York City, remember that Manhattan is just a skinny island (albeit, a very famous one) and there are 4 other boroughs (can you name them?), which are home to 7 million New Yorkers combined.  So you can apply this last piece of advice to not just getting off the beaten path in Manhattan, but venturing off the island of Manhattan for a deeper exploration.</p>

							<p>This map serves as a guide of for your adventure into the city. The New York City Subway travels throughout the 5-Boroughs. At times, this may be the fastest way to navigate throughout the city.</p>
