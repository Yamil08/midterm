<br></br>
							<p>Arguably one of the most famous parks in the world, Central Park is a manmade wonder.  Not only is it the first public park built in America, but it is also one of the most frequently visited, with over 25 million guests per year.</p>

							<p>Set in the middle of bustling Manhattan, its grounds serve as a safe haven, not only for athletes, daydreamers, musicians, and strollers, but also for teems of migratory birds each year.  One can spend an entire peaceful day roaming its grounds, gazing upon nearly 50 fountains, monuments, and sculptures or admiring its 36 bridges and arches.</p>

							<p>With recreational facilities abounding, the more energetic won’t have a problem finding a spot to skate, pedal, row, dribble, or climb to his or her heart’s delight.  Although Central Park has 21 official playgrounds, we like to think of it as one gigantic jungle gym in its peak season.</p>

							<p>150 years’ worth of visitors have enjoyed and recommended Central Park; don’t you think it’s time for your turn?</p>

  <h3>Places to Visit</h3>
  <ul>
					<li>Bicycling and roller skating. The Park Drives, which circle the entire park, are the best place to bicycle or do in-line or roller skating, with a dedicated lane for their use. Skaters can also use any of the paved trails running through the park, but bicyclists are prohibited on all pedestrian pathways. Bicycle rentals are available from the parking lot of the Loeb Boathouse, the parking lot at Tavern on the Green and at Columbus Circle. Authorized vendors will have physical locations in the park and utilize credit card machines and offer helmets with the rental, whereas illegal vendors will walk customers off park property for their bikes or will have bikes chained to street furniture surrounding the park</li>
					<li>Water recreation. Catch-and-release fishing is available at the Harlem Meer, and a shop with bait and poles is located at the north end of the Meer. Swimming is offered at the outdoor Lasker Pool at the north end of the park; admission is free, but you are restricted to bringing only a towel, shoes, book, and water bottle and must bring a lock; no bags allowed. Boating is available in two kinds: row boating at The Lake (boats can be rented from the Loeb Boathouse for $12 for half an hour and $6 for an additional 15 min and model sail boating at the Conservatory Pond.</li>
					<li>Delacorte Theater. Home to the Public Theater/New York Shakespeare Festival in the summer.</li>
